From one of the demonstrators:

"I was guilty of not reading the practical carefully, and so I was confused by what on earth was going on at first 
with the tree display in the system.out.  As a result, I traced the program through (drawing my own tree as I went - see attached) as what I was
 seeing didn't match up with what I expected.  And then I realised that the tree was viewed sideways, and it does in fact say this in the practical. 
 So two things:

1.  Watch out for confused students with that!

2.  I found it really useful to add some nodes of my own and actually go through the 
printTree method, and all its recursive methods, using System.outs and paper to work out what is going on and draw my own tree step by step
 (see attached quick photo of my own working).  As part of the checkpoint, it might be worth asking the students to draw something like this so
 that they have a full understanding of what is going recursively with the program? It would also mean they spend the first 20 minutes actually
 going through the program and working it out before they get on with the order.  They SHOULD then find the practical very reasonable as the actual
 code needed is very minimal.
